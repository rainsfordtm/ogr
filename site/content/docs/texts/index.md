## Texts

The corpus contains __twenty-two__ texts. Click on the link to read the text.

1. [__The Sequence of Saint Eulalia__](/docs/eulalie). Composed 881..2, copied
in the late ninth century.
The first literary text in any Gallo-Romance variety, the short 29-line
poem presents the martyrdom of Saint Eulalia. It is preserved in the
earliest manuscript containing a Romance text.
2. [__Fragment of a bilingual sermon on Jonah__](/docs/jonas). Composed and
copied in the first half of the tenth century.
Preserved by chance in the binding of a codex, this single folio contains
notes in Latin and Old French for a sermon on Jonah. The recto is severely
damaged and barely readable and the first words of each line of the verso
were lost when the parchment was cut. Much of the text is written in shorthand
(Tironian notes).
3. [__Bilingual Alba__](/docs/alba). Composed and copied in the tenth
century at the latest. A short "dawn hymn" written primarily in Latin
with an enigmatic two-line refrain in Romance, repeated three times.
4. [__Passion poem, Augsburg manuscript__](/docs/passaugsb).  Composed and copied in the tenth
century. A short Romance song, copied in a single line _before_
a legal document was copied on the parchment in 1067. The writing is
very small and faint and can only be read from the original (see Berschin
et al. 1981).
5. [__Clermont Blessings__](/docs/benclerm). Composed and copied in the
mid- to late tenth century. Two short Romance blessings written upside-down in the
margins of a Latin manuscript of the _Breviary of Alaric_.
Discovered by Bischoff (1984).
6. [__The Strasbourg Oaths__](/docs/serments). Composed 842, copied c1000.
The earliest text by date of composition in any Gallo-Romance variety, the _Strasbourg Oaths_
consist of two short oaths sworn in both Romance and Germanic by Louis
the German, Charles the Bald and their followers in 842. They are
preserved within Nithard's Latin chronicle _Historiae filiorum Ludovici pii_.
7. [__Life of Saint Leger__](/docs/sleger). Composed in the tenth 
century, copied c1000. 
The 241-line poem narrates the life and martyrdom of Saint Léger. Like the _Passion of Clermont_
in the same manuscript, the influence of southern Gallo-Romance is clear, but the text is
more clearly of northern origin.
8. [__Passion of Clermont__](/docs/passion). Composed at the end of the
tenth century, copied c1000. This 516-line poem is the earliest Romance
retelling of the Passion of Christ. It is typically considered a northern
Gallo-Romance text, although the language shows significant mixing of
northern and southern features which makes it difficult to interpret as
a coherent system. The manuscript records a line of the melody
to which it was sung, and also contains the _Life of Saint Leger_.
9. [__Two stanzas of an Old French love song__](/docs/chanslas). Composed and copied in the final third
of the eleventh century.
Two stanzas of Old French love songs presumably transcribed from
memory by a German-speaking scribe.
10. [__Sponsus__](/docs/spons). Composed before 1100, copied in the late
eleventh or early twelfth century.
A dramatic setting of the tale of the wise and foolish virgins in a mixture of
Latin and a southern Gallo-Romance variety with many northern features,
particularly at the rhyme.
11. [__Prayer to God in verse \(Te Autem\)__](/docs/prdieu). Composed and
copied in the late eleventh or early twelfth century.
A short prayer in decasyllabic verse, titled _Tu Autem_ in the manuscript.
12. [__Prayer to the Virgin in verse \(Mei amic e mei fiel...\)__](/docs/prvierge2).
Composed and copied in the late eleventh or early twelfth century.
A prayer to the Virgin in verse narrating the Annunciation with alternating
Latin and Romance stanzas and a Latin refrain.
13. [__Prayer to the Virgin in verse \(Versus sancte Marie\)__](/docs/prvierge3).
Composed and copied in the late eleventh or early twelfth century.
A prayer to the Virgin in verse relating salvation to the original sin of 
Adam and Eve, titled _Versus Sancte Marie_ in the manuscript.
14. [__Song of Saint Faith__](/docs/sfoi). 
Composed in the second third of the tenth century, copied in the late
eleventh or early twelfth century.
The 593-line poem recounts the martyrdom of Saint Faith of Conques and the subsequent downfall
of the pagan emperors. The text is from the south-west of the Gallo-Romance area
and shows features similar to Catalan.
15. [__Boeci fragment__](/docs/boeci).
Composed before 1100, copied in the early twelfth century.
The 258-line fragment is from a poem paraphrasing Boethius' _De Consolatione philosophiae_.
16. [__Protocol for a trial__](/docs/epreuvejudic).
Composed and copied in the early twelfth century.
In Latin and Old French, the text presents the protocol to be followed
in a religious trial.
17. [__Fragment of a Romance of Alexander__](/docs/alexalb).
Composed before 1110, copied in the first quarter of the twelfth century.
A 105-line octosyllabic fragment, this is the earliest surviving
version of the _Romance of Alexander_ and shows Franco-Provençal
features. Attributed by later sources to Alberic of Besançon.
18. [__Life of Saint Alexis__](/docs/alexis).
Composed c1090, copied 1120..1130.
The 625-line narrative poem recounts the life of Saint Alexis and is both
 the longest text in the corpus and the only text to be preserved in
 more than one manuscript. Only the oldest manuscript transcribed here
 dates from the first half of the twelfth century. The manuscript was
 copied in England and shows Anglo-French features.
19. [__Prologue to the life of Saint Alexis__](/docs/alexisprol).
Composed and copied 1120..1130.
A short prose prologue (or preface) to the _Life of Saint Alexis_,
only present in this manuscript.
20. [__Extract from Saint Gregory's letter on religious images__](/docs/sgregpaint).
Composed and copied 1120..1130.
A translation of an extract from a letter of Saint Gregory on the use of
religious images. It is copied directly below the Latin original (not included
in the corpus).
21. [__Epistle of Saint Stephen__](/docs/epset).
Composed and copied c1130.
A sixty-line stanzaic poem telling the story of the martyrdom of Saint
Stephen, developing the text of the Vulgate which is cited in the 
headings of each stanza. (Acts, ch. 6-7).
22. [__Quant li solleiz... paraphrase of the Song of Songs__](/docs/cantqusol).
Composed and copied in the first half of the twelfth century.
A 93-line poem paraphrasing the _Song of Songs_.

## Guide to transcriptions

The transcriptions are presented in two formats:

+ a __uniform__ transcription, without diacritics or punctuation and with word division standardized across the corpus;
+ a __diplomatic__ transcription, representing the manuscript reading but with abbreviations resolved.

### Uniform transcription

The uniform transcription deliberately doesn't 
conform to standard editorial practice for Old French or Old Occitan,
in part because the modern norms for these two languages are different.
Its purpose is to present the text in the manuscript in a consistent,
readable, but very basic form. It shows:

+ all characters present in the manuscript once abbreviations have been resolved;
+ standardized word division with all words, including clitics, separated by whitespace;
+ no diacritics;
+ no punctuation in verse texts and a single slash ("/") at the end of sentences in prose texts;
+ modern layout (verse lines, paragraphs, bulleted lists, etc.).

In addition, colours and font styles are used to enhance readability:

+ __Grey background__: section of text not in Old Gallo-Romance (usually in Latin)
+ __Italicized text__: word not in the matrix language of the sentence (usually a Latin form in a Romance sentence)
+ __Maroon text in square brackets__: text not present in the manuscript

## Diplomatic transcription

The diplomatic transcription represents the manuscript text with
original punctuation and diacritics. In the TXM and ANNIS editions,
the diplomatic transcription follows the layout of the manuscript page[^1].
In the online edition, a modern layout is used to so that the transcriptions
can be presented side-by-side. Original line divisions are shown by a
pipe ("|"). Colours are font styles are used to indicate the following:

+ __italicized text__: characters represented by a manuscript abbreviation
+ __text in small caps__: Latin word written using Tironian shorthand (Jonas)
+ __maroon text__: editorial intervention:
	+ in square brackets: an addition or a correction
	+ with strikethrough: a deletion.
+ __blank space with grey highlighting__: gap in the manuscript text.

[^1]: However, for technical reasons words cannot be split across lines. 
Instead, a pipe ("|") is used inside the word which is split
and the new line begins with the following word.
