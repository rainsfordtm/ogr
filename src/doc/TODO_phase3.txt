OGR phase 3
===========

Overall goal of phase 3: 
	* to advance the technical infrastructure to the point at which the corpus
		is both (i) usable and (ii) publishable via bwCloud / ogr-corpus.org.
	* to document the corpus in a publication for the CMLF

* Improve the TXM-RCP version:
	* Test the "flattened" metrical properties. Can they be improved? How?
		* TODO
	* Improve the look of the HTML edition 
		* current version is OK regarding lines and general font
		* strophes must be added, ideally with numbers
			* can this be done by the import?
		* random page breaks must be eliminated - all the text on one page? DONE
		* possible to add corpus-specific .css NOT NECESSARY
	
* Generate a TEI-compliant export of the text - IN PROGRESS
	* should also be used --- at least a version of it --- for the TXM import.
		* use a front-XSL to make it conform to XML/w+CSV import module for TXM
			* TODO: build the front XSL
	* script to generate a sensible header for the file.
		* FIRST: write the header like it should look
		* THEN: work out what goes in the master and what in the individual
		files
		* FINALLY incorporate the header writer into the exporter
	* IMPLEMENTATION: DONE
		* COMPLETE - except
			* add punctuation as <pc> element DONE
			* update export_text (only scan_text updated) DONE
	
		
* Make the Alexis text conform to the normalized transcription rules of all
	the other texts (no capitalization, no diacritics).
	
* Target date for completion of phase 3: December 2021
------------

* OGR PHASE THREE UPDATE

	* Essential:
		* fix the Alexis text DONE
		* test the TXM properties DONE
		* write a paper TODO
	* Would-be-nice:
		* fix the TXM edition to AT LEAST show the bloody verse divisions. DONE
		* add <gap/> element (in particular for Alexis edition; won't show up in ANNIS) DONE
		* add a diplomatic edition for TXM DONE
		
* Final corpus preparation:
	* check all cases in which phon_map is not the right length DONE
	* add a line length property to the TXM export DONE
	* proof-read the editions, in particular to remove any corrections which seem excessive (e.g. _porlier_) DONE
	* add the <gap/> element DONE
	
* Export corpus - now ready to do
* Update website - now ready to do
* AND WRITE A PAPER

BUG FIXES for v0.3
==================
* Something is wrong with syll_metpos involving elided syllables at the epic
caesura (particularly elidable syllables), causing the final "c" not to be
written.
* TXM jump to word is not working well at all.
	
		
OGR phase 4
===========

Overall objectives of phase 4:
	* to add all further pre-12th-century manuscripts to the corpus, other
		early 12th-century manuscripts, and thereby to reach version 1.0.
	* to publish the corpus on other platform to ensure maintenance
		(Oxford Text Archive)
		
* Enquire about a TXM-web portal for the OGR:
	* Demande d’ouverture de portails TXM : Les demandes d’ouverture de portail
		sont à adresser à cogrid@huma-num.fr : l’utilisateur effectue une demande
		écrite précisant le contexte général de sa demande (projet concerné et
		équipe de recherche). Huma-Num lui remet un formulaire décrivant
		l’organisation du support et la gestion du portail, ainsi que des
		informations qui sont à nous retourner.
		
Target date for completion of phase 4: April 2022
