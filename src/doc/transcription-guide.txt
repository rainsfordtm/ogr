Guide to phonemic transcription
===============================

**********************************
A reminder on transcription files:

- The TRANSCRIPTION file will give as much information as is available
from the graphical form; no more, no less.
- Non context-specific disambiguation must be manual.
- Merger of otherwise differences given in the graphical form must be manual.

Standard transcription rules:

CONSONANTS:

Velars:
- Final position (rare):
	- post-consonantal <c>/<g> transcribed as /K/
	- post-vocalic <c>/<g>:
		- weak: transcribed as /G/ (usu. only Occitan influence)
		- strong (former geminate): transcribed as /K/

- Strong position:
	- <g>, <gu> before <e>, <i> = /g/
	- <k>, <qu>, <c> = /k/

- Weak position:
	- in most OF texts intervocalic <k> and <g> should not be found:
	either <i> or lost. Text-specific rules required.
	

Coronals:
- Final position:
	- post-vocalic:
		- weak <t> and <d> transcribed as /ð/
		- strong <t> ( < pr.-fr. geminate) transcribed as /T/
	- post-consonantal <t> and <d> transcribed as /T/
	- final <z> transcribed as <Ç>
	- final <s> transcribed as <S>
- Strong position:
	- Oppositions:
		- <d> = /d/
		- <t> = /t/
		- <c> before <i>, <e> = /Ç/ (no /ʣ/) 
		- <j> or <g> before <i>, <e> = /ʤ/
		- <ch> = /ʧ/
		- <s> = /S/, also in coda position
- Weak position:
	- Oppositions:
		- <t> = /t/
		- <d> = /d/ or /ð/, lexically dependent
		- <dh>, <th> as /ð/
		- <z> = /ʣ/
		- <sc> or <c> before <i>, <e> = /ʦ/
		- <g> before <i>, <e> = /Č/
		- <ss> = /s/
		- <s> = /z/
- Pre-consonantal position:
	- <s> = /S/, generally no other coronals found.
	
Labials:
- Final position:
	- final <p>/<b> = /P/
	- final <f>/<v> = /F/
- Medial/initial position:
	- Oppositions:
		- <p> = /p/
		- <b> = /b/
		- <f> = /f/
		- <v> = /v/
		
Nasals:
- Final and intervocalic position:
	- Oppositions:
		- <m> = /m/
		- <n> = /n/
		- <gn>, <ign>, <ng> = /ɲ/

- Pre-consonantal EXCEPT before a nasal (incl. monosyllables)
	- only /N/
	
Liquids:
- Intervocalic position:
	- Oppositions:
		- <l>, <ll> = /l/
		- <il>, <ill> = /ʎ/

- All other positions:
	- only /L/
	
VOWELS:
- Back vowels:
	- <o> = /u/ or /ɔ/
		- in texts with spontaneous <ou> diphthongs, the transcription /ú/ can
		be used to indicate [-cons] for the first element of the diphthong.
	- Neutralization before a nasal: /O/
	
- Non-back vowels: non-mid vowels:
	- <u> = /y/ or, if value is uncertain, /U/.
	- <i> = /i/
	- <a> = /a/
	
- Non-back vowels:
	- Pretonic position and pre-nasal position
		- <e> = /E/
	- Tonic position:
		- <e> must be disambiguated into:
			- /e/ < tonic blocked /e/, flattened /ie/ diphthong
			- /ɛ/ < tonic blocked /ɛ/
			- /æ/ < tonic free /a/
				- in Occitan-influenced texts, /A/ can be used for reflexes of
				tonic-free /a/
	- Post-tonic position:
		- /ə/ only
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on symbols used in the Passion:

Intervocalic consonants:
- Evidence for a merger of Lat. p/b is shaky; on this basis, merger of t/d and
	k/g also doubtful. The Occitan system is used here.

Coronals:
- Graphical confusion of final dental stops, affricates and /ð/. The following
	transcription rules are followed:
	- default transcription is /Z/ (underspecified coronal)
	- where no possible final /s/ or affricate: either /T/ (supported) or /D/
	(unsupported)
		- except for monosyllables _et_ and _ad_, transcribed eð and að 
- Affricates are generally transcribed /Ç/:
	- opposition neutralized in strong position (no /ʣ/)
	- unclear sometime in intervocalic position whether voicing occurs or not, e.g.
	/dizen/, /dicen/.
- For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that /d/ and /ð/ are in opposition
in intervocalic position and before /r/.
	- /ð/ and /ðr/ represent the normal transcriptions of these clusters
	- /d/ and /dr/ are used in Latinisms
	- geminate transcriptions in peddre, petdres, etc. are ignored --- they
	are perhaps indicative of an /rr/ rather than a /r/ development.
- /s/ and /z/ are only in opposition intervocalically; elsewhere /S/ is used.
	- the spelling <ss> in intervocalic position is interpreted as /s/, not a
	geminate.
	
Velars:
- Similar conventions followed as for the coronals, i.e.
	- final velars: /K/
	- <qu>/<gu> digraphs transcribed consistently as velar stops (/w/ has fallen
	in some contexts)
	- no palatalization of /k/, /g/ before /a/
		- update Dec 2022: the ċ and ġ symbols were introduced in this text
		following northern conventions.
	- geminate graphies <cc> transcribed as single consonant.
	- geminate <gg> in <veggra> transcribed as single consonant (poss. lengthening
	due to loss of nasal).

Labials:
- Intervocalic and final labials are transcribed with the highly underspecified
/B/ phoneme - a combination of uncertainty of realization and unclear phonemic
oppositions ([v], [ß], [b], word-final [p]).
- Asymmetry with other categories deliberate: there are few intervocalic [b]
(unlike [g]) and there is confusion between strident/non-strident fricatives
(unlike [s]/[ð]).
	- Final labials:
		- /F/ in <salv> (origin is strident fricative)
		- /P/ also possible (if origin is geminate) but not attested.

Nasal:
- In word-internal codas the underspecified /N/ phoneme is used EXCEPT before
	another nasal or before /s/ (cases of [ms])
- Geminate graphies are interpreted as single consonants.

Laterals:
- In word-internal codas the underspecified /L/ phoneme is used.
- Geminate graphies are interpreted as single consonants.

	
Rhotic:
- Geminate graphies interpreted as geminate.

/w/:
	- only used in Germanic borrowings as a single onset /w/ 
	
/h/:
	- only in Germanic borrowing and cases of intervocalic /f/ > /h/ (<ahanz>)
	
Vowels:
-------
Front mid vowels.
- The default transcription in all except post-tonic position is /E/.
- /e/ is transcribed:
	- at the TONIC...
	- when from VL /e/
	- also in the <ei> diphthongs, i.e. diphthongs formed from VL [e]
		plus yod, e.g. *dreit*, *rei*.
- /ɛ/ is transcribed:
	- at the TONIC...
	- when from VL /ɛ/
	- in the Occ. perfect <-ed> forms
- /æ/ is transcribed:
	- for all reflexes of tonic free a[ not subject to diphthongization, 
	however they are written
- /E/ is transcribed:
	- for all cases where Northern GR would show the /iE/ diphthong, including
	reflexes of tonic free a[ (in practice, nearly always written <e>).
	- in the pretonic.
- /ə/ is transcribed in post-tonic position. 

Rounded vowels
- The default transcription is /O/ except at the tonic before a non-nasal consonant.
- /u/ is transcribed:
	- at the tonic when from VL /o/
- /ɔ/ is transcribed:
	- at the tonic when from VL tonic blocked /ɔ/.
- /O/ is transcribed:
	- at the tonic, when from VL tonic free /ɔ/.
	- in the pretonic
- /U/ is transcribed in Latinisms.
- /y/ is transcribed when from VL /u/

High vowel /i/:
- /i/ corresponds to <i> in the graphy, except where it develops in strong
	position.
- Intervocalic /i/ is transcribed as geminate when before a /iɛ/ diphthong
	(rare in this text).
- /I/ is transcribed in cases of VL pal. + /e/, variably written <i>, <e> and <ei>

- The <ei> digraph is treated in this text as a diphthong (Exception: <bein>).sfr
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on symbols used in SLeger:

Velars:
- Final <k>/<g> transcribed as <K> : all arise through Occitan influence,
	fricative pronunciation is to be excluded.

Coronals:
- The <ct> digraph is usually transcribed as T, as is <c> before
	<z>.
- The <th> digraph denotes [t].

Labials:
- Final <p> in <cap> transcribed as /P/: Occitan form. Contrast final <v> in
	<quev> (transcribed /F/).
- Final <b> in <ob> and <ab> transcribed as /P/ as phonetic value unclear.

Nasals:
- Geminate spellings are transcribed as simple consonants throughout (except [rr])
	- simplification of <mm> in <comander>

Post-tonic vowels:
- Evidence for merger of <e> and <a> (albeit limited), so [ə] is transcribed
(e.g. <cartres>, <dures>)

Back vowels:
- No evidence of /au/ > /ɔ/ so /O/ transcribed in pretonic position.

Non-back low vowels:
- In general there is a northern French vowel system, shown in particular
	by clear evidence for merger of /ie/ < pal. + /a/ and /ie/ < /ɛ/
	Note that Bartsch's Law does not usually apply in the south-west 
	(Goerlich 1882: 24-25).
- Vowels are distinguished as in NFr. The borrowed Occitan -e- perfects,
	which are not derived historically from an -a[ vowel, are transcribed [ɛ].
- The <ie> digraph is confusingly used. It systematically indicates a STRESSED,
	TENSE vowel (/e/, /iE/ or /æ/).	
	It is transcribed etymologically as /iE/ (where etymological), /æ/ or /e/.
	Where historical /iE/ has been flattened, the transcription /E/ is used.
	(For the scribe, /E/ was probably [ɛ] due to Occitan
	influence, but given the assonance in the text it may have been [e] for the
	author. It does not merge with /æ/.)
	- The issue is complicated by the fact that <ci> is used as a digraph for
	/Ç/, e.g. in <cio>.
	- It is possible that <ie> was regularly pronounced [e(:)] as opposed to
	<e> pronounced [ɛ].
- The value of <uo> is also mysterious.
	- in <duos> and <suos>, where the diphthong represents a Latin hiatus,
	the transcription /úu/ is used.
	- in <buons> and <duol>, where the diphthong can only have arisen through
	primary diphthongization but is inconsistently written, the transcription
	/O/ is used.
	
- Where <o> represents a non-diphthongized [ɔ] in <ols>, <noit> it is also
	transcribed /O/.
	
Mid-vowels:
- The digraph <ie> is not only used for cases of the diphthongization of 
/ɛ/ but also for reflexes of tonic free /a/ after a non palatal (<laudier>),
reflexes of tonic blocked /ɛ/ (tiemps) and reflexes of tonic blocked /e/
(ciest). It is therefore interpreted simply as an alternative form for <e>
and disambiguated as such.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on symbols used in Alexis:

The main problem in this text are the VOWELS:

Rounded vowels:
- /y/ and /u/ are treated as separate phonemes, although not systematically
	distinguished orthographically.
- /U/ is transcribed in Latinisms.
- There is no evidence of spontaneous <ou> in the text, and so /u/ is transcribed
	throughout in these positions. /úu/ is used only for secondary diphthongs
	such as <ou> < UBI.
- Where the /uɛ/ diphthong (written <oe>) has flattened to <o> in the spelling,
	the transcription /o/ is used (cf. Pope:§553)
	
Unrounded vowels:
- /e/ is used both for reflexes of tonic blocked /e/ AND for numerous 
	cases in which the /ie/ diphthong has flattened (cf. Pope:§512).
	
- /Æ/ is used for all cases of pretonic /a/ or /e/ before a nasal in a closed
	syllable, as there 	is strong evidence of merger in this position, although
	not at the rhyme.
	
Palatals:
- Evidence for retention of /ʎ/ is slight and instead the sequence /iL/ is
	transcribed.
- Evidence for retention of /ɲ/ is more mixed but sufficient (<gn> spellings,
	variation is spelling of "seinor, senior, seignur". The composite 
	transcription /iɲ/ is used except in the Latinate "regne"
	
Final consonants:
- Place neutralization of nasals before /S/ attested (<tens>, etc.)
	
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on symbols used in Serments:

The vowels, in particularly the lack of diphthongs, are again the main
problem:
	- Second-wave diphthongs are transcribed undiphthongized, i.e.:
		- /A/ is used for tonic free /a/
		- /e/ is used for tonic free /e/ (written <i>, also when tonic blocked)
			- According to Avalle (1965), this is a "Merovingian" tendency.
		- /u/ is used for tonic free /o/ (written <u>).
		
	- The first-wave diphthongs in <vol> and <pois> may have flattened
		or may never have developed; consequently /O/ and /U/ are used
		respectively.
		
	- Evidence that -a and -e have merged <sendra>, <fazet>: -ə transcription
	used.
		
Consonants:
	- /ɣ/ is used in <sagrament>
			
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on symbols used in CantQuSol

The degree of hypercorrection in final graphical consonants shows
clearly that many have become unpronounced. As a consequence, the
following sound changes, despite the presence of a consonant in the
written form, have been modeled:
	- <et>: final <t> is always unpronounced. The digraph typically
	denotes /ə/.
