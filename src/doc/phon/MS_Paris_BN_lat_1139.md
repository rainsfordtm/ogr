Annotation of texts in Paris BN lat. 1139
=========================================

General
-------

The texts were written by a scribe from the north of the Limousin 
[@SponsusA: 27]. The provenance of the *Sponsus* text is northern, but it
is not clear where from. Avalle ([~@SponsusA: 27-45]) argues for a 
south-western origin, primarily on the basis of a lack of evidence that
the digraph 〈ie〉 actually represents the diphthong /iE/; Thomas ([~@SponsusT])
argues less convincingly that it is Norman, based on parallels with the 
language of the *Alexis* manuscript, which shows at least a graphical fusion
of these vowels.

Thomas ([~@SponsusT]) argues that words within the lines of the *Sponsus* are
all Limousin in origin, noting the retention of tonic free /a/ as 〈ie〉.
Only the rhymes and a few isolated words with the lines are clearly northern
in origin.


Vowels
------

* *Tonics*: i e ɛ A ɔ o y
* *Pretonics*: i E A O y
* *Atonics*: I E A O
* *Diphthong*: au

### á[ > 〈e〉 

The vowel system follows Occitan norms with the exception that in *Sponsus*
á[ > 〈e〉. Contrary to Thomas' assertions, this does not occur only at the
end of the line in *Sponsus*, and of the three cases of á[ > 〈a〉 given by 
Thomas, only *preiat* is valid within the *Sponsus* itself. The other
three texts show no trace of á[ > 〈e〉.

Avalle ([~@SponsusA: 28-40]) argues that there is comparatively little evidence
that Poitevin ever saw the diphthongization of /ɛ/ > /iɛ/; its reduction is
in any case general. Reflexes of palatal + á[ then also do not diphthongize 
and remain as /ɛ/.

In the absence of clear evidence, the transcription /ɛ/ is used for all
reflexes of á[ in *Sponsus*. This also fits with the fact that it assonates
with person 5 verb endings of non *-ar* verbs, which would contain an
/ɛ/ vowel in Occitan.

### EN > AN

There are sporadic in *PrVierge3* in closed atonic syllables, including
one in which 〈en〉 is used for /AN/. In this text, the /Æ/ transcription is
therefore used (cf. *Alexis*). See [@SponsusT:95].

In *PrVierge2* there are two cases at the tonic and the rhyme both involving
〈an〉 for /EN/. These are transcribed following the spelling as /AN/.

Consonants
----------

The consonants follow the Occitan transcription conventions with the 
following different interpretations:

### Palatalization of /k/ before /a/

The digraph 〈ch〉 is consistently used before 〈a〉 indicating palatalization.
The northern transcription conventions, /ċ/ and /ġ/, are used. 

### Vocalization of /l/

Clear evidence that /l/ was vocalized to /w/ in these texts. Where written
〈u〉, the consonant is transcribed as /u/.

### /ʦ/

In word-final position, the affricate is consistently written 〈t〉 in all 
texts. This is transcribed /T/ rather than /Z/, since it does not affect
expected cases of final 〈s〉.

In onset position, 〈s〉 and 〈c〉 are occasionally confused in all texts.
This is taken as evidence that /Ç/ and /S/ have merged; /S/ is transcribed.

### Final devoicing

It is possible that final devoicing does not apply: Thomas notes the retention
of 〈b〉 in 〈sab〉 and 〈chab〉, commenting that "aucun autre exemple de cet
état archaïque ne se trouve dans ces différents textes, mais rien non plus
le contredit" ([~@SponsusT: 97]).
