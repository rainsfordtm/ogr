Annotation of texts in Paris BN lat. 1139
=========================================

General
-------

The texts were written by a scribe from the north of the Limousin 
[@SponsusA: 27]. The provenance of the *Sponsus* text is northern, but it
is not clear where from. Avalle ([~@SponsusA: 27-45]) argues for a 
south-western origin, primarily on the basis of a lack of evidence that
the digraph 〈ie〉 actually represents the diphthong /iE/; Thomas (~@SponsusT)
argues less convincingly that it is Norman, based on parallels with the 
language of the *Alexis* manuscript, which shows at least a graphical fusion
of these vowels.
