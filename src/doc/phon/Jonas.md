Annotation of the Jonas text
============================

General
-------

The text can be localized as Walloon, showing a number of typical Walloon
features and nothing which cannot be attributed to the Walloon area
[@Avalle1967: 87].

Vowels
------

* *Tonics*: i e ɛ æ a ɔ o y
* *Pretonics*: i E A ɔ o y
* *Posttonic*: ə
* *Diphthongs*: iE uE

### 〈ou〉

Avalle ([~@Avalle1967: 91--92]) argues that the 〈ou〉 digraph must represent
[u] in this text on the basis that it is found not only in the reflex of
ó[ (*correcious*) but also of ò[ + labial, where differentiation to \[uɛ\]
is often blocked [@Pope: §555]. \(In *souev*, however, it is a glide,
cf. [~@Avalle1967: 94--95]).

Following the transcription conventions for Old northern GR, which do not
reconstruct the vowel \[u\], 〈ou〉 is transcribed as \[o\].

### 〈au〉 = [ɔ]

The Latin \[au\] diphthong has flattened in *oieds*, *odit* so the 〈au〉 
digraph in *repauser* is assumed to be Latinate.

Consonants
----------

* Extras: ʃ

### [ʃ]

Avalle [-@Avalle1967: 98] argues that Latin -skj-, -ks-, -sk- and -tj-
give \[ʃ\] in this text, a common feature of Walloon, Lorraine and Burgundian
dialects. This is denoted in the text by a 〈sc(i)〉 digraph. Also noted
by [@Pope: §315] for the northern region.

### [ʎ]

Unusually, \[ʎ\] may be written 〈lg〉 in this text [@Avalle1967: 100] and
this is notable with the palatalized form of prevocalic forms derived from
ILLI, a north-eastern feature [@Pope: §1321.xv]. In *peril*, the palatal 
is written as a simple 〈l〉 [@Avalle1967: 100]; in *doliants* as 〈l〉
[@Avalle1967: 81].
