Annotation of the Jonas text
============================

General
-------

The text can be localized as Walloon, showing a number of typical Walloon
features and nothing which cannot be attributed to the Walloon area
[@Avalle1967: 87].

Vowels

* *Tonics*: i e ɛ æ a ɔ o y
* *Pretonics*: i E A ɔ o y
* *Posttonic*: ə
* *Diphthongs*: iE uE

### 〈ou〉

Avalle ([~@Avalle1967: 91--92]) argues that the 〈ou〉 digraph must represent
[u] in this text on the basis that it is found not only in the reflex of
ó[ (*correcious*) but also of ò[ + labial, where differentiation to \[uɛ\]
is often blocked [@Pope: §555]. \(In *souev*, however, it is a glide,
cf. [~@Avalle1967: 94--95]).

Following the transcription conventions for Old northern GR, which do not
reconstruct the vowel \[u\], 〈ou〉 is transcribed as \[o\].

### 〈au〉 = [ɔ]

The Latin \[au\] diphthong has flattened in *oieds*, *odit* so the 〈au〉 
digraph in *repauser* is assumed to be Latinate.
