Geminate consonants:
********************
In general, geminate sonorants in this text are transcribed as geminates.
- Sonorants:
	- geminate <rr> is transcribed as a geminate
	- Latin geminate <ll> and <nn> are consistently transcribed word-internally
		but inconsistent in word-final position.
		Transcriptions: /LL/ and /nn/ respectively, when graphy is geminate.
	- It is possible given the south-western origin of the text that [ll]
		palatalizes (cf. Ronjat 1932: §303). However, <nn> never palatalizes
		in Occitan varieties (Ronjat 1932: §302), only in central/southern Catalan 
		
- Obstruents:
	- <ss> is taken to represent [s], also in final position.
	- Single <s> is taken to represent a phoneme underspecified for voice
		in word-final position (presumably assimilated) and is transcribed /S/
	- Single <s> intervocalically is taken to represent /z/ and is transcribed
		as such.
	- Final <s> is treated as intervocalic after a simple vowel, regardless of
		etymology.
	- <cc> and <gg> are interpreted as velar stops (incl. <gg> before <e, i>
		in impf. sbjv.)
		
Intervocalic consonants:
************************
	- <d> denotes [ð] when descended from single intervocalic [-d-] in Latin.
	- elsewhere, <d> denotes [d], including where < single intervocalic [-t-].
		In some (mainly Provençal) dialects, however, the dentals have merged
		(cf. Ronjat §267).
		
Final consonants:
*****************
SFoi (exceptionally) does not show evidence for final consonant devoicing,
	i.e. obstruent voicing oppositions are retained word-finally.

Affricates [ʦ] and [ʣ]
**********************
	- Results here are broadly the same as French:
		- [ʦ] < [k] + [e, i], [tj] in strong position and [kj] in all positions;
		- [ʣ] < [k] + [e, i], [tj] in weak position. (Ronjat 1932: §227)
	- Opposition thus in intervocalic and final (post-vocalic) position.
	- Where the affricate is give by an occlusive + [s] after syncope, it is
		marked as two segments.
		
Glides before palatals
**********************
- <i> before a palatal is written as a separate segment --- it is not always
	present before <nn> or <ll> graphies.
	
Glides after velars
*******************
- <gu>, <qu>: For Latin <gu>, <qu> the glide is retained before /a/ even in
	modern dialects in Aquitaine (Ronjat 1932: §247). /gw/ < Germanic 
	/w/ is conserved in all contexts in Aquitaine.
	- Germanic /w/ is transcribed consistently as /w/
	- Latin /w/ is transcribed consistently before /a/ but not other vowels.
	
Labials + dentals following syncope
***********************************
- Outcomes of pt, bt and vt sequences developed through syncope is extremely
	variable across modern dialects although the most common eventual outcome
	is the loss of the labial. The graphy of the source text is respected:
	- the transcription /P/ is used for <b> and <p> (Ronjat 1932: §309)
	- the transcription /u/ is used for <u> ([v] assumed not to be possible).
	
Latin -ct-
**********
- In SFoi the regular outcome is [it] and is transcribed as such (Ronjat 1932:§311)
- The other main result is [ʧ].
	- Boeci dreita, drez, dreça. <zc> is used in forfazc 

Vowels:
*******
Seven-vowel system /i e ɛ a ɔ u y/ annotated in tonics only.

	- <ei> from etymological [a] + pal. is transcribed [ɛi] as per the edition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on symbols used in Sponsus:

Tonic free vowels:
	- Clear evidence of tonic-free <a> > <e>, but assuming that the OCCITAN
		vowel system is used, these are transcribed as [ɛ] rather than [æ]
	- Reflexes of palatal + tonic free [a] are also written <e> but are
	freely mixed in assonance with developments after non-palatals.
	
P5 ending:
	- Assonance tells us little about whether the OF [æ]/[iE] generalization
	has taken place. Annotation assumes that it has. (CHECK THIS).
	
Final consonants:
	- As in *Passion* the underspecified /Z/ transcription is used for all
	final coronals, as there is no clear distinction between /T/ and /Ç/.
