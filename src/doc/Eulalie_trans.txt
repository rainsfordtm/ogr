1	Eulalia was a good young girl.
2	Her body was beautiful and her soul more beautiful still.
3	The enemies of God wanted to win her over.
4	They wanted to make her serve the devil.
5	She doesn't listen to the evil advisors:
6	[who ask] that she renounce God, who resides in heaven above.
7	Not with gold, nor silver, nor finery,
8	[not] with royal threats or entreaties:
9	No means could make her change her mind
10	[so that] the girl would not always love the service of God.
11	And so she was brought before Maximien,
12	who was king in those days over the pagans.
13	He urges her - she doesn't care about it -
14	to abandon her Christian name.
15	She gathers up her strength.
16	She would rather endure the shackles
17	than lose her spirtual purity.
18	And so she was put to death with great dignity.
19	Into the fire they threw [her body] so that it would burn quickly.
20	She had no sins, and so it did not burn up.
21	The king of the pagans did not want to believe this.
22	He ordered her head to be cut off with a sword.
23  The young lady did not object to this.
24	She wanted to leave the world and calls upon Christ.
25	In the form of a dove she flew to heaven.
26	Let us all pray that she consents to pray for us,
27	so that Christ might have mercy on us
28	after death and let us come to him
29	through his gentle mercy.
