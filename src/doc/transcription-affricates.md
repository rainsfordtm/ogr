This transcription is not necessary: ʦ > ʧ is a *later* sound change in 
the north-east which we can assume post-dates the texts in question
(Scheer et al. 2020: §97.1).

Transcription rules
-------------------

* Use Ç, ʦ, ʣ and ʤ for the first wave of palatalization (all texts);
	Ç is used when the voicing contrast is not relevant.
* Use Ċ, ċ and ġ in all northern GR texts for the reflex of /k/ before /a/.
	* not necessary in the "pure" southern GR texts, CHECK WHICH
* TODO: how to transcribe southern GR ʧ which come from a different source?
	* retain ʧ in the table?
