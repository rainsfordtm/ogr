BRIEF DESCRIPTION
-----------------

The main branch of this repository contains the source files for the 
OGR Corpus:
* `csv/textcsv`: source texts
* `cfg`: files necessary for compiling and exporting the corpus
* `doc`: metadata and documentation

Before the corpus can be used, the source files must be processed and
exported using the syllabic verse analysis (SylVA) tools available on Sourceforge:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/syllabic-verse-analysis/

**The main branch contains work in progress!** Some source texts are not finished
and will cause errors if the scripts in SylVA are used on them.

If you want to use the corpus, please download the latest release:
